      <h2> 5 pirates</h2>
      <p>
      5 pirates of different ages have a treasure of 100 gold coins.<br>
      On their ship, they decide to split the coins using this scheme:<br>
      The oldest pirate proposes how to share the coins, and ALL pirates (including the oldest) vote for or against it.
      If 50% or more of the pirates vote for it, then the coins will be shared that way. Otherwise, the pirate proposing the scheme will be thrown overboard, and the process is repeated with the pirates that remain.<br>
      As pirates tend to be a bloodthirsty bunch, if a pirate would get the same number of coins if he voted for or against a proposal, he will vote against so that the pirate who proposed the plan will be thrown overboard.<br>
      Assuming that all 5 pirates are intelligent, rational, greedy, and do not wish to die, (and are rather good at math for pirates) what will happen?
      </p>

<div id="a1" class="ques">
    <br><h2>Our Solution:</h2>
    <p>The oldest pirate will propose a 98 : 0 : 1 : 0 : 1 split, in other words the oldest pirate gets 98 coins, the middle pirate gets 1 coin and the youngest gets 1 coin.<br>
    Let us name the pirates (from oldest to youngest): Alex, Billy, Colin, Duncan and Eddie.<br>
    Working backwards:<br>
    2 Pirates: Duncan splits the coins 100 : 0 (giving himself all the gold). His vote (50%) is enough to ensure the deal.<br>
    3 Pirates: Colin splits the coins 99 : 0 : 1. Eddie will accept this deal (getting just 1 coin), because he knows that if he rejects the deal there will be only two pirates left, and he gets nothing.<br>
    4 Pirates: Billy splits the coins 99 : 0 : 1 : 0. By the same reasoning as before, Duncan will support this deal. Billy would not waste a spare coin on Colin, because Colin knows that if he rejects the proposal, he will pocket 99 coins once Billy is thrown overboard. Billy would also not give a coin to Eddie, because Eddie knows that if he rejects the proposal, he will receive a coin from Colin in the next round anyway.<br>
    5 Pirates: Alex splits the coins 98 : 0 : 1 : 0 : 1. By offering a gold coin to Colin (who would otherwise get nothing) he is assured of a deal.

      <h2> Apples and Friends</h2>
      <p >
      You have a basket containing ten apples. You have ten friends, who each desire an apple.<br>
      You give each of your friends one apple.<br>
      Now all your friends have one apple each, yet there is an apple remaining in the basket.<br>
      How?

    <br><h2>Our Solution:</h2>
    <p><br>You give an apple each to your first nine friends, and a basket with an apple to your tenth friend.
    Each friend has an apple, and one of them has it in a basket.<br>
    (Alternative answer: one friend already had an apple and put it in the basket.) <br></p>

      <h2> Bags of Marbles</h2>
      <p >
      You have three bags, each containing two marbles. Bag A contains two white marbles, Bag B contains two black marbles, and Bag C contains one white marble and one black marble.<br>
      You pick a random bag and take out one marble.<br>
      It is a white marble.
      What is the probability that the remaining marble from the same bag is also white?
      </p>
      <a href="#a3"><input id="b3" type="button"  value="  see answer " >    </a>   <br>
</div>
<div id="a3" class="ques">
    <br><h2>Our Solution:</h2>
    <p><br>2/3 (not 1/2)<br>
    You know that you do not have Bag B (two black marbles) so there are three possibilities<br>
    You chose Bag A, first white marble. The other marble will be white<br>
    You chose Bag A, second white marble. The other marble will be white<br>
    You chose Bag C, the white marble. The other marble will be black<br>
    So 2 out of 3 possibilities are white.<br>
    Why not 1/2? You are selecting marbles, not bags.<br>

     <h2> Burning Island</h2>
      <p >
      A man is stranded on an island covered in forest.<br>
      One day, when the wind is blowing from the west, lightning strikes the west end of the island and sets fire to the forest. The fire is very violent, burning everything in its path, and without intervention the fire will burn the whole island, killing the man in the process.<br>
      There are cliffs around the island, so he cannot jump off.<br>
      How can the man survive the fire? (There are no buckets or any other means to put out the fire)<br>

</div>
<div id="a4" class="ques">
    <br><h2>Our Solution:</h2>
     <p><br>
      The man picks up a piece of wood and lights it from the fire on the west end of the island.<br>
      He then quickly carries it near the east end of he island and starts a new fire. The wind will cause that fire to burn out the eastern end and he can then shelter in the burnt area.<br>
      The man survives the fire, but dies of starvation, with all the food in the forest burnt.<br>

     <h2> Breaking up the chocolate bar</h2>
      <p >
      How many steps are required to break an m × n sized bar of chocolate into 1 × 1 pieces?<br>
      You can break an existing piece of chocolate horizontally or vertically.<br>
      You cannot break two or more pieces at once (so no cutting through stacks).<br>

<div id="a6" class="ques">
    <br><h2>Our Solution:</h2>
    <p><br>
      You need m×n - 1 steps.<br>
      By breaking an existing piece horizontally or vertically, you merely increase the total number of pieces by one.<br>
      You already have 1 piece, so need m×n - 1 steps to get to m×n pieces.<br>

      <h2> Black and White hats</h2>
      <p >
      Cannibals ambush a safari in the jungle and capture three men. The cannibals give the men a single chance to escape uneaten.<br>
      The captives are lined up in order of height, and are tied to stakes. The man in the rear can see the backs of his two friends, the man in the middle can see the back of the man in front, and the man in front cannot see anyone. The cannibals show the men five hats. Three of the hats are black and two of the hats are white.<br>
      Blindfolds are then placed over each man's eyes and a hat is placed on each man's head. The two hats left over are hidden. The blindfolds are then removed and it is said to the men that if one of them can guess what color hat he is wearing they can all leave unharmed.<br>
      The man in the rear who can see both of his friends' hats but not his own says, "I don't know". The middle man who can see the hat of the man in front, but not his own says, "I don't know". The front man who cannot see ANYBODY'S hat says "I know!"<br><br>
      How did he know the color of his hat and what color was it?<br>
      </p>
      <a href="#a7"><input id="b7" type="button"  value="  see answer " ></a>
</div>
<div id="a7" class="ques">
    <br><h2>Our Solution:</h2>
   <p><br>
     The man in front knew he was wearing a black hat because he knew the first man did not see two white hats and he knew that the second man did not see one white hat because if he saw a white hat, the second man would have known that his hat was black from hearing the first man's statement.
